Narrative
Travelers are currently not able to search for flights according to the travel time to or from the airport. According to our research, a large percentage of business travelers would book flights according to the travel time to and from the airport. Through a NYC airport Travel Time Index API, online booking engine can access integrate an easy-to-understand travel time score that can allow travelers to gain more clarity into ground travel times for each flight in their consideration set. By doing so, the goal is to ease traffic congestion to/from NYC airports at peak periods, by making the public aware of which flights correspond to peak travel times.
