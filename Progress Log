#Progress Log

Week 2
Progress for this week (8/28-9/3):
Worked towards setting a date for our first meeting
Performed initial research into airport operations and worked to understand all individual entities that join together to operate an airport 
Created a system diagram to represent the breadth of airport operations
Identified high-priority bottlenecks common to all airports as well as those specific to NYC area airports
Discussed possible areas for operational improvement using data
Brainstormed the first set of possible solutions

Plans for next week (9/4-9/10):
Take a deeper dive into the available data regarding airport operations
Prepare for our initial meeting
Research and understand how different stakeholder groups benefits from operational improvement at NYC airports
Strategize how to create the most value for a given stakeholder group and begin to plan our approach accordingly
Sketch early concepts and generate a corresponding narrative

Potential Risks:
Product scope still undefined; we aim to finalize this after our initial meeting
We do not fully know the boundaries we should adhere to in our solution (i.e. improving airline and airport operations vs. those of air traffic control)


Week 3
Progress for this week (9/4-9/10):
Ideated user stories and use cases
Continued research into bottlenecks at NYC airports and refined our system diagrams to hone in on the areas we believe may hold the biggest potential improvement
Brainstormed 80 possible solutions, narrowed this down to 4
Sketched early concepts for these 4 solutions

Plans for next week (9/11-9/18):
Meet with you and your team
Get all CSP agreements signed 
Make any course corrections that result after our meeting in terms of possible solutions
Dive deeper into the challenge
First Sprint!

Potential Risks:
Product scope still undefined; we aim to finalize this after our initial meeting


Week 4
Progress for this week (9/11-9/17):
Found sources of available public data, such as the TSA's wait time API and DHS' statistics on customs operations
Performed an analysis on the data, which led to key insights and opportunities for potential improvement.
Ultimately ruled out security lanes and TSA staffing as viable targets, given research into existing attempts at optimizing security wait times as well as the TSA's staff optimization software model.
Decided to focus on transportation challenges facing airports, given that this constitutes a major problem area for airports in both the short and long term.
Completed our first sprint and presented our findings to classmates and advisors.

Plans for next week (9/18-9/24):
Review and integrate feedback from last week's sprint.
Continue to discover additional sources of data as well as analyzing the data at our disposal.
Refine our approach towards optimizing transportation as a method of improving operations vis-a-vis data science.
Further flesh out a productized method of effecting an operational enhancement at NYC airports.


Week 6 (09/25-10/01)
For the past week, we have achieved the following milestones:
Updated progress in Trello
Defined multiple potential data sources
Contacted company advisors and went to Enigma office
Committed existing codes to code repo
Collected Real Time Traffic Data

Plans Next week

For the following week, we plan to:
Conduct Field trip
Identify relevant data sources
Define datat piplining tecniques
Exploratory data analysis for acquired data
Have a nice group dinner


week 7 (10/02-10/08)

For the past week, we have achieved the following milestones:
Pivoted idea and redone product design

Summarized feedback from Crit Session
Updated architecture diagram with respect to NCP
Send weekly status report

Plans Next week (10/09-10/15)

Continue to validate new narrative and product design
More background research on structure of travelling recommendation system
Explore and validate new data sources for new product design
Start to compile test data
Complete peer review surveys and summarize feedback
Prepare for Sprint 2
